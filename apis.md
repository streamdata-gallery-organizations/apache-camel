x-slug: apache-camel
description: Camel empowers you to define routing and mediation rules in a variety
  of domain-specific languages, including a Java-based Fluent API, Spring or Blueprint
  XML Configuration files, and a Scala DSL. This means you get smart completion of
  routing rules in your IDE, whether in a Java, Scala or XML editor. Apache Camel
  uses URIs to work directly with any kind of Transport or messaging model such as
  HTTP, ActiveMQ, JMS, JBI, SCA, MINA or CXF, as well as pluggable Components and
  Data Format options. Apache Camel is a small library with minimal dependencies for
  easy embedding in any Java application. Apache Camel lets you work with the same
  API regardless which kind of Transport is used - so learn the API once and you can
  interact with all the Components provided out-of-box. Apache Camel provides support
  for Bean Binding and seamless integration with popular frameworks such as Spring,
  Blueprint and Guice. Camel also has extensive support for unit testing your routes.
